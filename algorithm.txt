inputs:  library, rail, column, side, row


sanity checks:
     library >= 1
     1 <=  rail  <= 4
    -2 <= column <= 2 and column != 0
     side == 1
     1 <=  row   <= 4


calculate ACSLS LSM
    ( (4 * (library - 1)) + rail ) - 1


calculate ACSLS drive ID
2 dimensional array of ACSLS drive IDs:
    2  1 -1 -2
  +--+--+--+--+
0 |12| 8| 4| 0| 1
  +--+--+--+--+
1 |13| 9| 5| 1| 2
  +--+--+--+--+
2 |14|10| 6| 2| 3
  +--+--+--+--+
3 |15|11| 7| 3| 4
  +--+--+--+--+
    0  1  2  3

we'll use the column and row to index into the above array.

SL8500 row to array row is easy -> subtract 1

SL8500 column to array column:
    multiply by -1
	SL8500 column numbers:  -2 -1  1  2
     array column numbers:   0  1  2  3
    if negative, add 2
    if positive, add 1
	SL8500 column numbers:   0  1  2  3
	 arrau column numbers:   0  1  2  3

index into array using array row,column that we've calcuated to retrieve ACSLS drive ID


outputs:  LSM, drive ID, (return error)
